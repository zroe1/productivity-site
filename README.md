For the last four months I have been keeping track of how I spend each fifteen minute block of time in a giant spreadsheet. This website displays this data, updating by the moment. There is even a chart that shows everything I have done so far durring the current day.

The site is currently at the following domain but I am going to buy a new one: <b><a href="https://zephaniahsdata.netlify.app/">zephaniahsdata.netlify.app</a></b>

## Building this site

This is React project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This was my first time working with Next.js and I found the experience really interesting and I learned a lot from it.
